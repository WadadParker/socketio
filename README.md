# Socket.io 

- We will first setup a normal repo with socket.io & express.
- - Use express to create a web server & create a server instance
- - use createServer function of node:http 
- Setup Socket.io
- - import Server from socket.io library
- - Create a new instance of websocket server io
- - From index.html, setup a client socket instance to emit message from client to the socket server (now that's cool)
